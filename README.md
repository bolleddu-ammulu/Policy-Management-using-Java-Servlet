# POLICY MANAGEMANT SYSTEM
The Policy Management System is a web application developed using Java Servlets and JSP for managing insurance policies. 
It connects to a MySQL database for persistent storage of policies. The project demonstrates the implementation of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing policy data and includes a login mechanism to secure access. 
The user interface is designed with HTML forms and JSP pages, and policy records are displayed in a tabular format.
